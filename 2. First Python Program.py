### In this program we just used a print function
# and in this function whatever we pass in brackets () in double quote or single quote
# it get printed as it is (without quotes).

print("Hello World !!")

## Run this on terminal/CMD

# > python .\2FirstPythonProgram.py  ## you can also type 'python 2.' then Tab ##

## Output :

# Hello World !!

# Print function basically prints the return type from any other function.
# some function dont return new string/list instead they modify the actual string/list in place.
# if print function return something (list/string) it means it modify the actual list and print us new list/string
# if print function return NONE means it is not going to return new list/string instead it change the original list/string in place
