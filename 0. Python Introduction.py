# Python Programming language was developed by Guido Van Rossum in February 1991. 
# It is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

# Programming helps human to reduce manual efforts and 
# work which take hours to complete can be accomplished by computer in Seconds.

# To write any language’s code we need a platform where 
# we can write the code and can execute it. 
# For this we use IDE’s.

# IDE – IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
# is a software application which provides many comprehensive facilities 
# to programmers for software or application development.

# You can use Pycharm and Visual Studio Code as IDE
